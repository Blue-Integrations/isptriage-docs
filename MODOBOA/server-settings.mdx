description: "We use Modoboa, currently a supported open source mail system, with a very open API.
We currently have 1 mail server implemented with the system, its hostname is:

https://mail01.vir.isptriage.com

In providing the services through this node, access can be given to manage via the core admin, which will in turn update the details in ISP Triage, and vice versa.

To use the server you need to apply an MX entry, priority 10, to mail01.vir.isptriage.com.

Email domains and alias' are free, but user accounts (takes up hard drive space) cost $1.50/per month presently.  "
